## Introduction

Vue (pronounced `/vju:/`, like view) is a **progressive framework** for building user interfaces. 
It is designed from the ground up to incrementally adoptable, and can easily scale between a library and a framework depending on different use cases.
It consists of an approachable core library that focuses on the view layer only, and an ecosystem of supporting libraries that
helps you tackle complexity in large Single-Page Applications.

#### Browser Compatibility

Vue.js supports all browers that are [ES5-compliant]()(IE8 and blow are not supported).
